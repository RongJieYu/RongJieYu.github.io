## Project Experience

### Virtual Simulation System for Middle School Chemistry Based on Unity3D

This project is a virtual simulation system for middle school chemistry experiments developed based on the Unity3D engine. The system integrates plugins such as DoTween and Highlight, as well as Json data persistence technology, using an animation system and refined 3D models to simulate and provide a high-quality virtual experimental experience. In addition, the system integrates a quiz system and data persistence function, fully supporting experimental assessment and learning progress tracking. The project content covers experimental principle analysis, 3D experimental equipment display, interactive experimental operation demonstration, and teaching video integration, aiming to provide students with an intuitive, interactive, and comprehensive platform for learning chemistry experiments.
